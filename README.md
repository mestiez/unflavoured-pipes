**Unflavoured Pipes adds a copper pipe that can transport items over short distances.**

Important aspects:
- Pipes only work when powered with redstone
- A pipe only extracts items from an inventory when fully powered (level 15 redstone)
- Items follow the flow of redstone inside the pipe
- A pipe can hold at most four stacks
- Pipes transfer one item every 5 ticks
- I really recommend installing [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade) to see whats inside the pipes if you're confused
- The pipes can feed into composters and end portal frames
- Pipes conduct redstone
- Just look at the gallery

I tried my best to make these pipes look and act like they are part of vanilla Minecraft. They're not overpowered, have fair limitations, and integrate with vanilla mechanics.
